Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to practicing HTML and CSS.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-   Flexbox concepts
    -   We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
-   Media queries
    -   All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
